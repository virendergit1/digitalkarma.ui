Data must be transmitted, stored, destroyed, and protected based on its classifi cation. The company has three classifications: public, proprietary, and private. The owner of the information must establish and communicate the level of sensitivity:    
                                1.  No or low sensitivity: Generally available to the public   
                                2.  Medium sensitivity: Internally communicated information available to most or all employees   
                                3.  High sensitivity: Business-related data that should not be available to competitors or outsiders   
                                4.  Very high sensitivity: Proprietary information that could cause substantial impact if inappropriately disclosed; private information that should not be disclosed   
                                5.  Top secret information: Defi ned by executive management">
