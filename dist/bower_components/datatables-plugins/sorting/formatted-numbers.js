/**
 * This plug-in will provide numeric sorting for numeric columns which have
 * extra formatting, such as thousands separators, currency symbols or any other
 * non-numeric data.
 * 
 * By default when a cell is found to have no numeric data its value is sorted
 * numerically as if its value were 0. This could also be altered to be Inifnity
 * or -Infinity as required.
 *
 * DataTables 1.10+ has formatted number detection and sorting abilities built-
 * in. As such this plug-in is marked as deprecated, but might be useful when
 * working with old versions of DataTables.
